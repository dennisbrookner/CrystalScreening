`traytable` provides methods for 
 - storing all information about a crystallization screen in a dictionary of dictionaries
 - extracting and tabulating all data about "hits" into a `pandas` dataframe.  

The goal of `traytable` is for all crystallization data to be inputted once and only once, and then conveniently looked up and reused whenever needed.

You can find a jupyter notebook with a brief demonstration of package functionality [here](https://traytable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/0_simple_example.html).

#### Installation
```bash
pip install traytable
```
